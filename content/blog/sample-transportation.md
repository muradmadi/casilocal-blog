Madrid has an excellent public transportation system that makes getting around the city easy and affordable. Here's everything you need to know as a student.

## Metro System

### Abono Joven (Youth Pass)

The best deal for students under 26. For just €20/month, you get unlimited travel on:
- Metro
- Buses
- Light rail (Cercanías) within Madrid

**How to Get It:** Bring your ID and proof of enrollment to any metro station  
**Savings:** Can save €50+ per month compared to regular tickets

### Single Tickets

If you don't travel much, single tickets cost €1.50-2.00 depending on zones. A 10-trip ticket (€12.20) offers better value.

## Bus System

Madrid's bus network is extensive and complements the metro perfectly. The same Abono Joven works on buses.

**Advantages:**  
- Goes places metro doesn't reach
- Great for seeing the city above ground
- Night buses (Búhos) run all night

## BiciMAD (Bike Sharing)

Madrid's public bike-sharing system is perfect for short trips and exploring.

**Cost:** €25/year for students  
**How It Works:**  
- First 30 minutes free
- €2 for each additional 30 minutes
- Download the app to find and unlock bikes

**Best For:** Short trips, exercise, exploring neighborhoods

## Walking

Madrid's city center is very walkable. Many students find they can walk to most places within 30 minutes.

**Benefits:**  
- Free
- Great exercise
- Discover hidden gems
- Better for the environment

## Taxis and Ride-Sharing

### Regular Taxis

Taxis are metered and relatively affordable for short trips, but can add up quickly.

**Base Fare:** €2.50  
**Per Kilometer:** €1.05

### Uber/Cabify

Ride-sharing apps are available in Madrid and can be convenient, but public transport is usually cheaper.

## Tips for Efficient Travel

1. **Get the Abono Joven** – It's the best value if you use public transport regularly.

2. **Use Google Maps or Citymapper** – These apps show the best routes combining metro, bus, and walking.

3. **Avoid rush hour** – If possible, travel outside 7-9 AM and 6-8 PM to avoid crowds.

4. **Walk for short distances** – If it's under 20 minutes, walking is often faster than waiting for transport.

5. **Combine transport modes** – Use metro for long distances, bus for shorter trips, and walk for the last mile.
