Living in Madrid as a student doesn't have to break the bank. With the right strategies, you can enjoy everything the city has to offer while staying within your budget. Here are our top money-saving tips.

## Transportation Savings

### Get a Student Transport Pass

The Abono Joven (Youth Pass) is a game-changer for students. It gives you unlimited travel on metro, buses, and trains within Madrid for just €20/month.

**Savings:** Up to €50/month compared to regular tickets  
**Where to Get It:** Any metro station with your student ID

### Walk When Possible

Madrid is a very walkable city. Many neighborhoods are compact, and walking is not only free but also a great way to discover hidden gems.

## Food Budget Strategies

### Cook at Home

While eating out is tempting, cooking at home can save you hundreds of euros per month. Shop at local markets like Mercado de San Fernando for fresh, affordable ingredients.

**Savings:** €200-300/month  
**Tip:** Cook in bulk and meal prep for the week

### Take Advantage of "Menú del Día"

Many restaurants offer a fixed-price lunch menu (€10-15) that includes starter, main, dessert, and drink. It's often the same food as dinner but at half the price.

## Entertainment on a Budget

### Free Museum Days

Many museums in Madrid offer free entry on certain days:
- Prado Museum: Free Mon-Sat 6-8 PM, Sun 5-7 PM
- Reina Sofía: Free Mon, Wed-Sat 7-9 PM, Sun 1:30-7 PM
- Thyssen: Free Mondays 12-4 PM

### Student Discounts

Always carry your student ID! Many places offer student discounts:

- Theaters: Student tickets available
- Gyms: Student memberships

## Shopping Smart

### Second-Hand Markets

El Rastro (Sundays) and various flea markets offer great deals on everything from clothes to furniture.
